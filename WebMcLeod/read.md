# Web with Todd McLeod

This folder has my practices with McLeod's Web programming with Go course available at Udemy.

Some of the samples are based on classes and modified by me to push the practice a little more.

## Templates

Objectives:
1. How to use functions, pass them
2. How to pass data to Templates, access it
3. Range or loop over data
4. Abstract and modularize our code
5. Nested Templates

__Templates__: they allow us to create one document and merge data to it.

## Notes:

* When serving files in a RESTful way, their file-extension does not matter.
